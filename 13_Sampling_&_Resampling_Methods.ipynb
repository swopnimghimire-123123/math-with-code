        "\n",
        "*   **Essence:** Take a subset of the population to make inferences.\n",
        "*   **Use Case:** We can’t always measure the whole population; samples save time and cost.\n",
        "*   **Example:** Survey 100 students to estimate the average study hours of 10,000 students.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Bootstrapping\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Essence:** Randomly resample your data (with replacement) many times to estimate statistics like mean, variance, confidence intervals.\n",
        "*   **Use Case:** Estimate variability when population is unknown.\n",
        "*   **Example:** Resample student exam scores 1000 times to get confidence interval of the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cross-Validation\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Essence:** Split data into train/test multiple times to check model performance.\n",
        "*   **Use Case:** Avoid overfitting; check robustness of ML models.\n",
